# Personal Portfolio #
Welcome to my personal portfolio :smile: :wave:. I expect to update
this repo with some frequency to reflect some of the work I have
performed since the previous update. I also expect to one day move the
contents to my own personal website, at which point I will likely stop
updating this repo.

### Cross-platform testing made possible by [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) ###

BrowserStack is _really_ **awesome**. I find it really useful that the mobile
devices run on the same OS versions from when they shipped. I can therefore
see how a page looks with the browser features of the time, as opposed to
checking only viewport characteristics as is often the case with browser
developer tools.
I **strongly** encourage you to give BrowserStack a try. (They are _quite_
generous with open source projects :wink:.)

Though I very likely will not accept any pull requests, you are more than
welcome to fork this repo and work with it :+1:.
